These scripts reproduce the main results of paper:
CLIMADA â€“ a global weather and climate risk assessment platform. Aznar-Siguan, G & Bresch, D. N.

Execute script_exec.py. The execution in a laptop should take less than 2 hours.

The script loads the TC track data (processed IBTrACS contained in sel_hist.p) 
in the containing folder and writes in the same folder
intermediate data as well as the figures. Consecutive executions of the
scripts will be faster because of the loading of intermediate results.

After the execution, the folder should have a size of 1.0 Gb.
