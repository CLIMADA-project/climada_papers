## Content

### ./notebooks/

Jupyter notebooks to reproduce figures that appear in the paper

### ./scripts/

Python scripts used to process data save intermediate results. In particular:
* *calibration_main.py* performs the spatially explicit calibration of vulnerability functions and saved impact function parameters and produces impact function plots.
* *hail_main.py* uses calibrated impact functions to estimate hail damages for different hazard-expsoure combinations and saves skill scores.
* *event_definition.py* performs the POH-based pre-processing of the building and car damage data
* *data_processing/grid_cantonal_data.py* collects damage and exposure data from all 4 cantons and combines it to a 1km gridded dataset.
* *data_processing/impact_to_netcdf.ipynb* saves impact data as netcdf file.

### ./scClim/

Contains functions which are called in other scripts for data pre-processing, calibration, visualizing, as well as utility functions and constants.

## Requirements
Requires:
* Python 3.9+ environment (best to use conda for CLIMADA repository)
* _CLIMADA_ repository version 3.3+:
        https://wcr.ethz.ch/research/climada.html
        https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python
* Exposure and damage data for the calibration. The hail damage data used in the paper are not public and only available within the [scClim](https://scclim.ethz.ch/) project. Calculation could be repeated with other user-provided data.
