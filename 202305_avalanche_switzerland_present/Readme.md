## Requirements

Requires the download of the hazard, exposure and vulnerability data from [https://www.doi.org/10.16904/envidat.398](https://www.doi.org/10.16904/envidat.398). All the downloaded files from the folder `20230502_Climada_Avalanche` should be placed into the   folder `data/`. To recompute the hazard sets from the RAMMS data input, also add the folder `RAMMS_input` into the folder `data/`.

Requires CLIMADA v3.3.0 (or later): [https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/](https://github.com/CLIMADA-project/climada_python/)
Documentation: [https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/](https://climada-python.readthedocs.io/)
